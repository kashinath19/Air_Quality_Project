# 🌍🌫️ Air Quality Project 🏙️📊
## 📖 Overview
The Air Quality Project analyzes air pollution trends across major urban cities to raise awareness about public health and inform policy-making. Leveraging a dataset of 10,500 air quality records from 2015 to May 2025, the project demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, and analysis through Excel and an interactive dashboard.

## 🖼️ Dashboard Preview

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset, air_quality_dataset.xlsx, contains:

Columns: Date, City, AQI, PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3, Temperature.

Simulates air quality trends for cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, New York, London, and Tokyo.

Data Quality Issues:

500 duplicates.

10% null values in PM2.5, NO2, and Temperature.

Mixed date formats (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD" vs. "DD/MM/YYYY").

Typos in City (e.g., "delhi" vs. "Delhi").

Invalid values (e.g., negative AQI).

## 🎯 Objectives
 🧹 Clean and preprocess messy air quality data.

 📊 Analyze pollution trends across cities, highlighting seasonal patterns and high-risk zones.

 🎨 Visualize findings in an interactive dashboard.

 🔮 Forecast future AQI levels to support public health initiatives.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
## Excel: 
🖊️ Used for data cleaning, transformation, EDA, and dashboard creation.

## ✨ Features
## 🧹 Data Cleaning
Removed 500 duplicates.

Imputed null values for PM2.5 and NO2.

Standardized date formats and fixed city typos.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified Delhi as the most polluted city (average AQI: 180).

Found strong correlations between PM2.5 levels and low temperatures (correlation coefficient: 0.75).

## 🎨 Dashboard Highlights
Bar Charts: Show average AQI by city and pollutant distribution.

Heatmap: Displays PM2.5 levels across months.

Interactive Filters: Allow slicing data by year and city.
